As we can observe from the two json reports the updated site performs better.

- The starting render time has been reduced by 1 second.
- LCP is also reduced by 0.5 second.
- speed index is reduced by 0.8 second, i.e content is more quickly visible to the users.
- More bytes has been used in updated site because of the cache stored.
- In the waterfall we can see that less request are made beacuse of the cache stored, hence faster

First View Run Updated site:
    first byte :    .376s
    start render : 1.1s
    LCP : 1.717s
    speed index : 1.471s

First View Run Original site:
    first byte :    1.519s
    start render : 2.200s
    LCP : 2.231s
    speed index : 2.245s


Improvements:

- the starting render time can be reduced by pre-rendering the pages.
- storing the response of apis for faster performance on api calls.
- with more cache being stored the performance will be improved.
